## Hello!

As stated in my bio, my interests are mostly for oil and gas industries data processing optimization through artifical intelligence. I also have knowledges (though still limited) in front end design and had explored several topics regarding cloud computing (thank you #JuaraGCP challenges). Currently working on my final year project with the topic of Capacitance Resistance Model (CRM/CM) for shut-in wells (see my latest repo).

### üñ•Ô∏è Languages I'm trying to be good at:
- Python
- JavaScript
- HTML/CSS
- SQL

### üß† Skills I'm trying to acquire from artificial intelligence topic:
- Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) and its optimization for varying time constants
- History Matching optimization through machine learning
- Processing optimization for industry-scale data

### ü§î Feel free to explore my curriculum vitae.
