## Hello!

As stated in my bio, my interests are mostly for oil and gas industries data processing optimization, through artifical intelligence (or not). I also have knowledges (though still limited) in front end design and had explored several topics regarding cloud computing (thank you #JuaraGCP challenges). My final year project has the topic of Capacitance Resistance Model (CRM/CM) for shut-in wells (see my pinned repo for more information). I mostly code to understand equations or concepts that I won't understand, be it in maths, physics, or petroleum engineering itself.

### üñ•Ô∏è Languages I'm trying to be good at:
- Python
- Rust (cause it's fast and reliable enough with PyO3)
- JavaScript
- HTML/CSS
- SQL

### üß† Skills I'm trying to acquire:
- Time varying optimization
- History Matching optimization through machine learning
- Processing optimization for industry-scale data

### ü§î Feel free to explore my curriculum vitae.
